# Advanced Computer Vision Assignments 1 and 3

The code for assignments 1 and 3 in Princeton's COS 529, which involve implementing Computer Vision techniques in Python.

## Belief Propagation

Implements Belief Propogation (as well as a brute force approach) to calculate marginals, gradients, and MAP estimates for a Markov Random Field.

## Bundle Adjustment

Implements 3D Bundle Adjustment using Levenberg Marquardt optimisation to find the poses of multiple cameras and the 3D locations of multiple points based on the cameras' observations of the points.
